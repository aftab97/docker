docker compose means you no longer need to run huge cmds to run docker files

dont need to specify network because docker automatically creates its own network

docker-compose up -d 
-d = detached mode

docker-compose down //removes all the containers but NOT volumes
docker-compost --build //forces images to be rebuilt
