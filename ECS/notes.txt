Two ways:
    1. Fargate (serverless)
    2. EC2 


Fargate:
Only creates server when needed (comparision to EC2 always running)

By using revisions in ECS > Task Revision

Changes Required for Prod:
No longer use bind mounts -> use instead COPY

Changes Required for ECS Prod:
For env variables use a .env key:value to assign
Also for networking: 
can no longer use service name instead use localhost pass in via process.enb.MONGODB_URL
HOWEVER for frontend:
you cant use localhost as it refers to users machine instead of server as it is being served by inside the 
container but instead the browser of end user
if fetch is done from URL within same container then you can use same URL so can do 
X localhost/goals -> /goals

NOTE:
When using ALB with multiple containers if GET to (/) path gives back 400 then healthcheck fails and the ALB does not deploy
to avoid change / to /{working-path} e.g. /goals

EFS:
To use EFS with fargate you create security group which the NFS Inbound Traffic to connect with the Security group used for cluster
