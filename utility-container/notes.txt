Utility Containers:

Can be used to use packages without having to install on your own machine
Use Case:
    I dont have node on local machine but can create a container with it

if you want to run commands after the container has run you can use:
    docker exec -it {container_name} {cmd}
    docker exec -t my_container npm init


docker run node -
